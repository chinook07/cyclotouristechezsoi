            <p>High school teacher living in Montr√©al, and soon-to-be programmer, I decided to learn some coding while sharing my knowledge of bicycle touring online. After completing my project, I went on to make a one-page site in English, so people outside Quebec could discover this excellent cycling destination. To contact me, you may use <ExternalLink href="https://cyclotouristechezsoi.ca/contact">the form</ExternalLink> found on the French-language section.</p>
